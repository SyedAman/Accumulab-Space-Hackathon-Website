								<h3>Our Service</h3>
								<p>Space travel has been shown to have detrimental physical and mental effects on the human body. Long term exposure to the absence of gravity has been shown to cause muscular-skeletal deterioration. With live stream communications still a problem in space, it is tough for an astronaut to communicate adequately with a physician. Accumulab aims to solve this problem by acting as a medium. It contains an archive of routine and emergency medical operations, as used by the International Space Station. These procedures are laid out in a step by step fashion that is guided by an Amazon Alexa to the astronaut. The goal is to lay out these operations ins an easy to understand manner so that the astronaut can perform it in both low and high priority situations. </p>

								<h4>Our Story</h4>
								<p>We are team of multidisciplinary engineers from New York University. Accumulab started as a platform that aims to solve the gaps in the academic research space by providing an assistant to streamline data entry and note-taking in a digital capacity. It also consolidates the fragmented space of academia in research by providing organizations and teams the capability to manage their projects from a macro level, as well as connect them to like-minded intellectuals around the globe. Since its inception in November 2016, Accumulab has garnered mounting support from the research community for its flexibility in use. We hope to showcase its flexibility by aiding astronauts in space as opposed to researchers on Earth. </p>
